# VanillaFix
Fixes some vanilla bugs in Outer Wilds

## Fixes
- Makes the proxy sun's atmosphere look correct. (credit to MegaPiggy)
- Properly resets PlayerState on scene change.
- Adds some missing button prompt textures. (credit to MegaPiggy)
- Prevents SetLanguage from being called when it shouldn't be, fixing several mods.
- Lets input turn off when the game isn't in focus, meaning mods that turn on runInBackground work.
- Unanchors the probe when the thing it's anchored to is destroyed.
